# RMF core ROS 1 messages

This repository holds the ROS 1 counterpart of the messages in the repository [rmf_core](https://github.com/osrf/rmf_core). Main use cases for these ROS 1 messages will be to bridge the `rmf_core` systems that are written in ROS 2, with legacy packages that are stable in ROS 1.

This effort will hopefully be phased out in the near future, as more and more systems adopt ROS 2. 

## Disclaimer

Messages here might sometimes not be synced with the latest versions in `rmf_core`.
